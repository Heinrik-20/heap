This is a mini project on the heap data structure. Coded in C, I have managed to achieve polymorphisim with the heap data structure.
In the heap.h file, the heap is defined and the function prototypes that will be useful when you use the heap. 
In the heap.c file, the functions are all defined there. 

I have also included a heap_sort function, hope this comes in handy if you need them. 
Some utilities for creating the heap is defined in the utils.c file. 

Besides, I have also created a main file accompanied by its relevant utilities to read in strings, build the heap, and sort them. 

Hope this is helpful for you all.
