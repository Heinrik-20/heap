This is a mini project on the heap data structure. Coded in C, I have managed to achieve polymorphisim with the heap data structure.
In the heap.h file, the heap is defined and the function prototypes that will be useful when you use the heap. 
In the heap.c file, the functions are all defined there. 

I have also included a heap_sort function, hope this comes in handy if you need them. 

Besides, I have also created two main files for some sample uses of the heap I created. 

Hope this is helpful for you all.
